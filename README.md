# SBXG




## Development Model

All the components (but the foreign root file system) are built from source,
using versioned configuration files (i.e. Linux/U-Boot/Xen/Busybox Kconfig
products).  This allows SBXG users to rely on the sources and their own (or
pre-packaged) configurations, instead of a black box downloaded from untrusted
sources.

SBXG provides default configurations for some boards, toolchains, kernels and
u-boot, to demonstrate its capabilities, but one of its goal is to be able to
use opaque (private) user configurations, that may not be included in the open
source version of SBXG.



## Pre-requisites

SBXG relies on third-party tools to fulfill its duty:
- `git`, to retrieve [genimage][4]'s sources,
- `python` (at least 3.4),
- the python packages `jinja`, `cerberus` and `pyaml`,
- `make`,
- `mkfs` (ext3, vfat),
- `build-essential` tools (to compile the kernel and u-boot),
- autotools programs (such as autoreconf, autoconf, ...) needed to compile
  genimage.

To make installation of these dependencies easier, scripts are made available
in the `utils/` directory. Select the one that matches your distribution, and
run it as a normal user (no sudo). Python and rust packages will be locally
installed, while packages will ask for the admin password.


```bash
./utils/install_debian_packages.sh # For Debian/Ubuntu/...
./utils/install_gentoo_packages.sh # For Gentoo
```

You may be asked to run by yourself additional commands, that cannot be safely
executed by these scripts, such as changing your environment variables.


## Documentation

More documentation is available in the `doc/` directory. It can be nicely
generated by [sphinx][7]. If you have `sphinx` installed, you can build the
documentation by running `make -C doc html`. The html documentation will be
available in `doc/build/html/`.
